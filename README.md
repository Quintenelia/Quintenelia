- 👋 Hi, I’m @Quintenelia
- 👀 I’m unique - as are we all - in an unusual way: I have three forenames, the third of which is possessed ONLY by me and no-one else (at the time of writing - 20210911) and you can see it in my username. This is not a nickname - it's a genuine forename that appears on my birth certificate from 1953 in the UK. My father also used this name as his third forename, but, as it turned out, it's not on his birth certificate, as we - his family - discovered when he passed in 1992. If you search online you'll see the word pop up here and there, but the instances all inevitably lead back to me (so far; someone could try creating fresh instances but they would all occur after my origin).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) as they relate to two unique projects upon which I've been working for a decade or so: (1) one that combines musical notation and anagrams as a steganographic method, and from extensive research I claim that no-one else has yet tried to combine these two to create a steganographic encryption technology, and (2) one that takes the content of (1) and converts it into a different representation, one based on a toy made of plastic bricks that hails originally from Denmark (you probably know the four letter name). I figure that either one of these unique projects - devised by someone with a unique name - ought to have some value based on ..er.. double-uniqueness (if there can be such a thing). Still working on this. There is a third possible project that could be based on a form of cellular automaton - a representation of (2) that has been progressed in a specific and reversible manner, if the direction of progression, and the number of iterations, are both known. Again, steganographic, and not what I would call 'true' encryption.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on these and possibly other related projects, in the fullness of time. I need to consolidate notes and experimental work (including software) going back to at least 2004 and possibly earlier (if I can establish the validity of my recollections).
- 📫 How to reach me: quintenelia[@]gmail[.]com is one method.
